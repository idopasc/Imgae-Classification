# Imgae Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network

Developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for visual image classification. The task is to categorize images into two categories: 'with sunglasses' and 'without sunglasses'.

This notebook covers the following steps:

* Employing a CNN to classify images as either 'sunglasses' or 'without sunglasses'.
* Performing preprocessing tasks like data transformation and scaling.
* Tuning hyperparameters to find the best configuration.
* Constructing and training the CNN model.
* Assessing the model's performance using a Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Learning Curve.

The project uses the 'FACES' dataset and is implemented in Python.
